# Cursor Rules for TypeScript VSCode Extension

## Code Style & Formatting

### Indentation
- **CRITICAL**: This project uses TABS for indentation, not spaces
- Always preserve existing indentation when editing files
- Do not convert tabs to spaces or spaces to tabs
- Use tabs consistently across all TypeScript, JavaScript, and JSON files
- When making changes, maintain the exact indentation style of the surrounding code

### TypeScript Best Practices
- Use strict TypeScript settings
- Prefer `const` over `let`, avoid `var`
- Use explicit return types for functions
- Prefer interfaces over type aliases for object shapes
- Use `readonly` for properties that shouldn't be mutated
- Avoid `any` type - use `unknown` or proper typing instead
- Use optional chaining (`?.`) and nullish coalescing (`??`) operators
- Prefer async/await over raw Promises
- Use type guards for narrowing types

### Code Organization
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
- Group related functionality together
- Export only what's needed - prefer private by default
- Use barrel exports (index.ts) for cleaner imports
- Follow the existing project structure

### Error Handling
- Always handle errors explicitly
- Use try-catch blocks for async operations
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Log errors appropriately for debugging

### VSCode Extension Specific
- Follow VSCode extension API guidelines
- Dispose of resources properly (subscriptions, disposables)
- Use VSCode's built-in APIs instead of external libraries when possible
- Test extension activation and commands thoroughly
- Keep extension size minimal - avoid unnecessary dependencies

### Comments
- Avoid obvious comments that just describe what the code does
- Write comments to explain WHY, not WHAT
- Document complex algorithms or business logic
- Use JSDoc for public APIs and exported functions
- Keep comments up-to-date with code changes

### Naming Conventions
- Use camelCase for variables and functions
- Use PascalCase for classes, interfaces, and types
- Use UPPER_CASE for constants
- Use descriptive names that clearly indicate purpose
- Prefix private members with underscore (_) when appropriate

### Imports
- Group imports: external libraries, then internal modules
- Remove unused imports
- Use absolute paths from src root when configured
- Keep imports organized and readable

### Dependencies
- This project uses npm (not bun or yarn)
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Minimize external dependencies
- Prefer well-maintained packages

## VSCode API Version
- Minimum required VSCode version: 1.76.0
- Use APIs compatible with this version
- Check VSCode API documentation for feature availability

## Build & Compilation
- Use `npm run compile:debug` for development builds
- Use `npm run build` for production builds
- Always run TypeScript compiler checks before committing
- Fix all TypeScript errors - do not ignore or suppress them

## Git Workflow
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Test changes before committing
- Run `npm run prepush` before pushing changes
